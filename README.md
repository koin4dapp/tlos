# TLOS setcode
Helper tools for TLOS block chain developer, deploy your code using eosjs@16.0.9

TLOS is EOS sister chain, there are still a little smart contract run on TLOS main mainnet, and still scarce resource for TLOS Developer.

Currently I am using <a href="https://www.eosstudio.io">EosStudio</a> to develop and compile my smart contract, but EosStudio provide no facility to deploy to TLOS mainnet, so I make my own tools without using cleos. This code I use to deploy my smart contract <a href="https://koin4dapp.appspot.com">Koin4Dapp</a> to TLOS mainnet using eosjs@16.0.9
