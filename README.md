# TLOS setcode
Helper tools for TLOS block chain developer, deploy your code using eosjs@16.0.9

TLOS is EOS sister chain, there are still a little smart contract run on TLOS main mainnet, and still scarce resource for TLOS Developer.

Currently I am using EosStudio to develop and compile my smart contract, but EosStudio provide no facility to deploy to TLOS mainnet, so make my ownr tools to deploy my smart contract without using cleos. This code I use to deploy <a href="koin4dapp.appspot.com>Koin4Dapp</a> to TLOS mainnet using eosjs@16.0.9
